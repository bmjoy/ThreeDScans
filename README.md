This repository contains scanned statue models which came from [the Three D
Scans project]. These models are optimized (decimated) for real-time rendering
use, especially for use with Unity game engine.

See [their Info page] for details. My understanding is that these models are
free to use for commercial/noncommercial purposes. Acknowledging them in some
way or making a donation to them would be a nice idea.

About the optimization process
------------------------------

These models are decimated, retopologized and UV-unwrapped with [Houdini]. The
Normal maps and the occlusion maps are generated with [xNormal]. The working
project files of this process is contained in another repository
([ThreeDScansWorking]), so you can see the details if you want.
